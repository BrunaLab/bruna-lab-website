## Course Objectives  
The objectives of this course are (1) to gain an understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that shape patterns of tropical diversity, (2) to learn some of the ways in which humans use tropical wildlife, and (3) to understand the the threats faced by tropical ecosystems and explore alternatives for their conservation. Although examples will be drawn from a variety of tropical ecosystems, the course will focus primarily on the American tropics.
