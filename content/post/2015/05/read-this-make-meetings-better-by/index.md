## Make your faculty, lab, and student committee meetings better by [reading this article from Fast Company magazine.](http://m.fastcompany.com/26726/seven-sins-deadly-meetings)

### The Seven Sins of Deadly Meetings (TLDR Version)

- **Sin #1:** People don't take meetings seriously. They arrive late, leave early, and spend most of their time doodling. **Salvation:** Adopt Intel's mind-set that meetings are real work.

 

- **Sin #2:** Meetings are too long. They should accomplish twice as much in half the time. **Salvation:** Time is money. Track the cost of your meetings and use computer- enabled simultaneity to make them more productive.

 

- **Sin #3:** People wander off the topic. Participants spend more time digressing than discussing. **Salvation:** Get serious about agendas and store distractions in a "parking lot." It's the starting point for all advice on productive meetings: stick to the agenda.

 

- **Sin #4:** Nothing happens once the meeting ends. People don't convert decisions into action. **Salvation:** Convert from "meeting" to "doing" and focus on common documents.

 

- **Sin #5:** People don't tell the truth. There's plenty of conversation, but not much candor. **Salvation:** Embrace anonymity.

 

- **Sin #6:** Meetings are always missing important information, so they postpone critical decisions. **Salvation:** Get data, not just furniture, into meeting rooms.

 

- **Sin #7:** Meetings never get better. People make the same mistakes. **Salvation:** Practice makes perfect. Monitor what works and what doesn't and hold people accountable.
