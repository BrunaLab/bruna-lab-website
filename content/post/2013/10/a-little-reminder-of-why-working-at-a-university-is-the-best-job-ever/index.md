This is one of the reasons I am so glad I work at a university - I am surrounded by young, energetic, creative people. The [University of Florida Symphony Orchestra](http://www.arts.ufl.edu/orchestra/) is having a [concert tomorrow night](http://www.arts.ufl.edu/news/calendar.aspx), and to advertise the strings were at the Century Tower with a stand, a baton, and a big sign that said "Conduct Us". Anybody that wanted to could come up and lead them in a performance of the [1st movement of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT48t-mWEiE). They would follow your lead - adagio, fortissimo, in rhythm, out of sync, whatever -- AND IT WAS AWESOME. Thanks UF Symphony for making me feel like [Gustavo Dudamel](http://www.gustavodudamel.com/) (ok, [Zubin Mehta](http://www.zubinmehta.net/)) on my birthday. The passion and joy with which you played reminded me how lucky I am to work with you and your fellow students every day.
