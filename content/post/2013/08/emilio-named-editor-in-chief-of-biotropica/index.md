Hello everybody...the rumors are true. The indefatigable [Jaboury Ghazoul](http://www.ecology.ethz.ch/people/Professors) has stepped down as Editor-in-Chief of _Biotropica_, and I will be trying to fill his shoes starting August 1, 2013. Our journal is recognized for publishing some of the most innovative and important research in tropical biology and conservation, and this is no small part due to the efforts of Jaboury and the EICs that preceded him. I am looking forward to working with Marielos, Wendy, Bryan, the Editorial Board, and the staff at Wiley to continue the initiatives Jaboury put in place, as well as to implement some exciting new ones…stay tuned to learn more about these in the coming months.You can find the offical press release at Wiley's [Biotropica Page](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291744-7429) and the new Editor's Blog: [Biotropica.org.](http://biotropica.org/)
