I've got to do some maps for a manuscript, so I've been working through different options for mapping in R. Here are some resources I've found useful, feel free to add in the comments.  Thanks to those of you who have [helped with my questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28838866/mapping-all-of-latin-america-with-rworldmap) (that means you, Andy)
