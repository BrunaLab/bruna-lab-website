**Salary:**  Commensurate with Qualifications and Experience

**Review Date:**  For full consideration, candidates should apply and submit additional materials by 15 December 2014. The position will open until a viable applicant pool is determined.

**Duties and Responsibilities:** This position is a 12-month tenure-accruing appointment available in the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, at the University of Florida. The appointment will be 40% teaching (College of Agricultural and Life Sciences) and 60% research (Florida Agricultural Experiment Station). The successful candidate will develop an internationally recognized teaching and research program that addresses global change impacts on wildlife and biodiversity. Duties will include: (1) teaching an innovative, state-of-the-art undergraduate course that provides a foundation in the concepts and tools of global change ecology and its effects on behavior, ecology and population dynamics of wildlife; (2) teaching a graduate course that integrates quantitative, theoretical, and field approaches to address wildlife management and conservation in a global change context; and (3) developing and supporting a rigorous, internationally recognized research program focusing on how large-scale, natural and anthropogenic drivers of change (e.g., climate, sea-level rise, biological invasions, diseases, fire regimes, pollution, land-use transformation, human population growth and sociopolitical factors) affect wildlife diversity in Florida, the Southeastern US, and abroad.

The successful candidate will engage in scholarly activities related to instruction, including teaching undergraduate and/or graduate courses, advising and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, participating in curriculum revision and enhancement, seeking funding for the teaching program, supervising undergraduate and graduate research and creative work, publishing teaching-related scholarship, producing learning tools, and engaging in professional development activities related to teaching and advising. Faculty are encouraged to support and participate in the CALS Honors Program, distance education, and international education. Position assignment may change in accordance with the needs of the department. Because of the IFAS land-grant mission, all faculty are expected to be supportive of and engaged in all three mission areas—Research, Teaching and Extension—regardless of the assignment split specified in the position description.

**Qualifications:** Candidates must possess a doctorate (foreign equivalent acceptable) in wildlife biology, ecological or biological sciences, or related natural resources discipline; evidence of scholarship and depth of knowledge in global change ecology; experience and willingness working with resource agencies and stakeholders; and commitment to teach and inspire undergraduate and graduate students while promoting a diverse educational and professional work environment. Postdoctoral experience is desirable. Candidates should have demonstrated skills in verbal and written communication, interpersonal relationships, and procurement of extramural funding. Candidates must also have a commitment to IFAS core values of excellence, diversity, global involvement, and accountability.

UF is a member of The Association of American Universities. The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences ([http://ifas.ufl.edu](http://ifas.ufl.edu)) includes the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences ([http://cals.ufl.edu](http://cals.ufl.edu)), the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station ([http://research.ifas.ufl.edu](http://research.ifas.ufl.edu) ), the Florida Cooperative Extension Service ([http://extension.ifas.ufl.edu](http://extension.ifas.ufl.edu)), the College of Veterinary Medicine ([http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu](http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu)), the Florida Sea Grant program ([http://www.flseagrant.org/](http://www.flseagrant.org/) ), and encompasses 16 on-campus academic departments and schools, 12 Research and Educational Centers (REC) located throughout the state, 6 Research sites/demonstration units administered by RECs or academic departments, and Florida Cooperative Extension Service offices in all 67 counties (counties operate and maintain). The School of Natural Resources and Environment is an interdisciplinary unit housed in IFAS and managed by several colleges on campus. IFAS employs over 2500 people, which includes approximately 900 faculty and 1200 support personnel located in Gainesville and throughout the state.

UF/IFAS also engages in cooperative work with Florida A&M University in Tallahassee.

The programs of the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation ([http://www.wec.ufl.edu/](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/)) emphasize biological and human dimensions of wildlife ecology and conservation in local to international arenas. Department faculty may be affiliated with the Center for Latin American Studies, Center for African Studies, and the School of Natural Resources and the Environment. Also housed with the Department is the Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, whose principal focus is on wetlands wildlife and ecosystem restoration and conservation. The nearby 3,600-hectare Ordway-Swisher Biological Station, managed by the UF Department of Wildlife Conservation and Ecology, provides an outdoor laboratory for teaching and a site for long-term field research, and has been designated to serve as a National Science Foundation NEON core site.
