Emilio has been awarded a [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/) [Special Visiting Researcher Fellowship](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/opportunities-for-individuals-from-abroad) from the Brazilian government. This three year award will allow Emilio to continue working with Dr. Heraldo Vasconcelos from the Univerisdade Federal de Uberlândia to understand how herbivores influence Cerrado plant demography.

[Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/) is an ambitious program launched by President Dilma Rousseff to consolidate Brazil as a global center of science and technology. They plan to do this in three ways. First, increasing the presence of students, scientists and industry personnel from Brazil in international institutions of excellence - basically, they pay all costs, including tuition, room and board, and insurance - for students or postdocs to spend a year abroad. Second, they encourage young and talented Brazilian researchers currently working abroad to return to Brazil for a while to work with investigators at Brazilian institutions on joint projects. They also fund foreign scientists to spend up to three months a year in Brazil working on collaborative research projects, teaching, and training students.  Finally, they promote the internationalization of universities and research centers in Brazil by encouraging the establishment of international partnerships.
