## Students

- **Fabiane Mundim**, Ph.D. in Wildlife Ecology & Conservation, 2016  
Fabiane's research was on above- and below-ground plant-herbivore interactions and how they are influenced by climate change. She did her field work in Brazil's Cerrado.

- **Ernane Vieira-Neto**, Ph.D. in Wildlife Ecology & Conservation, 2016  
Ernane's research was on how the expansion of road networks in Brazil's Cerrado influences the demography and spread of leaf-cutter ants.

- **Elan Simon Parsons**, MA in Latin American Studies, 2018
Simon's research was on the prevalence and functional form of edge-effects in fragmented landscapes.

- **Ana Cecilia Silva**, M.A. Student in Latin American Studies, 2015.  
Ana Cecilia completed her BA in Anthropology at the University of Florida with a minor in German. He MA thesis was on how Brazilian’s attitudes regarding extensive executive power influence support for affirmative action.

- **Paulo Rubim**, Ph.D., Universidade Federal de São Carlos, 2013  
Paulo completed his BS and MSc at UNESP where he studied the phenology of Atlantic forest tree species. His Ph.D. was on factors influencing Heliconia acuminata distribution and reproduction at multiple spatial scales. I co-advised Paulo with Dr. Dalva Mattos.
