One of the highlights of the 2013 ATBC meeting was getting to see Frank Joyce again. Frank is a legend in Costa Rican conservation and education circles - he's played an important role in conservation in the Monteverde region and has trained hundred's of students as the Coordinator and Lead Instructor of the [University of California's Tropical Biology Study Abroad Program.](http://eap.ucop.edu/OurPrograms/costa_rica/Pages/tropical_biology_quarter.aspx) Â  In 1993 I was a student in the program, and spent 10 glorious weeks in Costa Rica learning about tropical ecology and how to study it from The Man himself. Twenty years later I got to thank him again for the major impact he and his course had on my career.
