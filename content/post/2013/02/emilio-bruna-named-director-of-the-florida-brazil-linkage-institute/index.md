Philip Williams, Director of the [Center for Latin American Studies](http://www.latam.ufl.edu/), has named Emilio Bruna as director of UF’s [Florida-Brazil Linkage Institute](http://www.floridabrazil.org/) was created by the Florida Legislature to help strengthen the state’s foreign relations and to promote business, educational, cultural and scientific exchange between Florida and its largest international trading partner. In addition to administering the Out-of-State Tuition Exemption Program for qualified Brazilians students, the Institute links the resources of Florida’s state universities and colleges with those of state government and business to forge partnerships with Brazilian institutions. “My hope is that under Bruna’s leadership the Florida-Brazil Institute will become the go-to resource on Brazil for state government, academic, and business communities in Florida”, said Williams.
