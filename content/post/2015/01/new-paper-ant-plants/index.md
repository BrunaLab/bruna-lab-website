The [latest issue of _Ecology_](http://www.esajournals.org/toc/ecol/95/12) brings with it a [sweet new paper from the Amazon](http://brunalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bruna_etal_2014_Ecology.pdf).  In it our intrepid team -- Heraldo Vasconcelos, Brian Inouye, me, and our former postdoc Thiago Izzo -- report on how the identity of ant partners influenced the demography of the myrmecophyte\* _Maieta guianensis_. Props to Thiago for spending many, many, many days in the field, the team that developed the [IPMpack package for R](http://ipmpack.r-forge.r-project.org/) that really simplifies the use of Integral Projection Models to study demography, and the National Science Foundation for financial support. [And yeah...that's us featured on the cover](http://brunalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bruna_etal_2014_Ecology.pdf), with a great picture by Brian Inouye.

[Data and code we used are available to others for use and improvement](http://brunalab.org/publications/datasets/). You can read more about my experience with the process of preparing these archives [in this blog post](http://brunalab.org/blog/2014/10/17/no-citations-for-you/), which got a lot of traffic because, well...you'll see.

Enjoy!

_\*Myrmecophytes are plants with specialized structures such as swollen leaf pouches or empty stems or thorns in which ants establish their colonies. These ant species are specialists - [each only lives in a few species of plant](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040803) - and e[ach species of plant is colonized by only a few species of ant](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040803).  The ants forage for insects that are attacking the plant ([they recognize volatiles released by the plant](http://brunalab.org/?attachment_id=555) when it is damaged).  and in doing so defend the plant (their home) from herbivores, although [some are better at it than others](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/faculty/brunae/Publications/Bruna_et_al_2004_Oecologia.pdf)._
