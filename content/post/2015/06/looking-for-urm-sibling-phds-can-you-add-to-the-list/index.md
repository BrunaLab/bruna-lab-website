My brother [Sean](http://www.seanbruna.com), who is a medical anthropologist,  me an interesting question the other day after [@npralltech](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/06/05/412238440/-raceontech-sharing-the-experiences-of-diverse-innovators?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=alltech&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews) launched their search for diverse innovators in [STEM](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/06/05/412238440/-raceontech-sharing-the-experiences-of-diverse-innovators?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=alltech&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews) with the [#RaceOnTech](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/RaceOnTech?src=hash) hashtag (and I'm paraphrasing him here):

> Minority PHDs are under-represented in STEM, so do you think we're especially rare as URM siblings with STEM\* PhDs?

I have no idea, so asking for help from the twitter hive-mind. Do you know any sibling PhDs who are also URMs? Let us know in the comments.

\*Yes, his PhD is in Anthro. But it's Med Athro, and anyway social sciences are Sciences too.  And besides - the guy has probably spent more time working at the CDC than you have. So STEM.

Update 1 (7 June): @mbeisen correctly points out it might be a product of two small numbers...but how small js the denominator? So I guess we need to know if there are that many sibling phds in the first place, so add those too:

- Pringle
- Eisen
- Horvitz
- Sabbatini
- Bruna
- Aizenman
- ......

Update 2 (7 June): Aw, hell...let's invite all disciplines to the party.
