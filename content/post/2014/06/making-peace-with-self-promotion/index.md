[A great post on why self-promotion, when done right, is good for you and science in general.](http://compassblogs.org/blog/2014/05/30/making-peace-with-self-promotion/)  Jeremy Fox said it well:

> A good, nuanced discussion of an issue near and dear to any blogger's heart. I especially like the point that some level of self-promotion is good not just for you, but for science as a whole ([much as traits like ambition, self-confidence, and a willingness to evaluate the work of others can be good for science as a whole as well as you personally](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/book-review-the-silwood-circle/)).
