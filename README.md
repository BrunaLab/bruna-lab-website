## Welcome to the Bruna Lab Website Repository

This website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), an open source scientific and technical publishing system. It is based on the website created by the [Masiello Group](https://github.com/MasielloGroup/MasielloGroupWebsite), which they graciously made available on Github for others to learn from and use as a template. Note: the `_utils` directory contains helper scripts they created to use when migrating from Wowchemy / Hugo Academic to Quarto.
