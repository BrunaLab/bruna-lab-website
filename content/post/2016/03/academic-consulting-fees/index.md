A few weeks ago I participated in an event and I was asked by the organizers to estimate the "value of my participation" -- specifically the time spent preparing and delivering the presentation -- so they could report this to the granting agency and use it in future grant proposals. I had the same reaction I am sure many others in academia would have had when faced with this request:

Fortunately, they provided a calculator that seemed reasonable, so I am posting it here.

* * *

 

**Average US Hourly Professional Consulting Fees** _(Consultant Journal, 2006)_

- For services provided by an **entry-level professional**: salary and benefits / 1920 hours \* 2
- For services provided by an **mid- and senior-level professional**: salary and benefits / 1920 hours \* 3

 

**Examples**

- entry-level professional (salary+benefits estimated at $75,000): $80 per hour
- mid-level professional (salary+benefits estimated at $125,000): $195 per hour
- senior-level professional (salary+benefits estimated at $175,000): $275 per hour

 

There are other generic calculators out there, [this one from ConsultingSuccess.com](http://www.consultingsuccess.com/consulting-fees-calculator) is a little more complicated, and [this article from Forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/06/bostonconsulting-marsh-mckinsey-ent-fin-cx_mc_1106pricing.html) lays out the reasoning behind what you should charge, including geography and field (it also has a calculator).  Havign said that, the value above seems about right.  What do you think? Any other suggested resources on calculating consulting fees?

 

PS A question: do you bill for travel time to- and from the site?
