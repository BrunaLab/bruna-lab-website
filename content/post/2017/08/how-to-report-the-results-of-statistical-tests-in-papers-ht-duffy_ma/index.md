##### In sum: not really. Lots of books and papers tell you how to \*do\* the statistical test, but very few tell you how to report the results in the manuscript you are preparing to submit for publication. I'm compiling a list of the latter; if you know of any relevant blog posts, book chapters - or want to write a post yourself - just let me know via the comments. Thanks to [@duffy\_ma](https://twitter.com/duffy_ma) for suggesting an aggregation.

1. **GLM**: S[o, you did some GLM and compared with AIC. Congrats!](http://www.ashander.info/posts/2015/10/model-selection-glms-aic-what-to-report/) (Jamie Ashander).
