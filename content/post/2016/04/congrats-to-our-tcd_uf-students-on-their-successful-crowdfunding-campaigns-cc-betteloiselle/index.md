[Dr. Bette Loiselle](http://www.loisellelab.org/) and I teach a class called "[Fundraising for Tropical Conservation & Development Professionals](http://brunalab.org/las6291/)", and [one of our assignments is for students to explore the costs and benefits of crowdfunding](http://brunalab.org/las6291/individual-project/) by running a project of their own.  We learned  quite a bit from the first time we did this assignment - which by the way was a [huge success](http://brunalab.org/las6291/2014/04/10/individual-project-summary/) for us and the students - and I thought I would give a shout out to our students by letting everyone know how hard they worked and what a great job they did.  This is a repost from our [class website](http://brunalab.org/las6291/).

**Our crowdfunding campaigns  have ended and our class did great!** Here are some stats:

- **Grand total: $6483** (5 projects)
- No. of Donations: 221 _(some people donated to >1 project; actual no. of donors slightly lower)_
- Average Donation: $29.33
- Projects reaching 100%: 3/5\*

Overall I would consider this a huge success. It was especially impressive because only 5 days into the month-long campaign the students got an email informing them [Rockethub](https://www.rockethub.com/) had been acquired by another company and suspended their campaigns. After a few days of frantic emails and a herculean effort by [Kym in the LAS office](http://www.latam.ufl.edu/people/staff/) Rockethub was willing to extend to the original deadline and lower the fees (\*though one of the campaigns was permanently marked as 'completed', which really hurt the student's efforts).

Congratulations to our students, and thanks to all to donors!
