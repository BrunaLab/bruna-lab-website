I just wanted to give a shout out to a great open-access journal that fills a much needed empty niche for field biologists --  lists of biological inventories and notes on the geographic distribution of any taxon. The journal's name is  [Checklist: Journal of Species Lists and Distributions](http://www.checklist.org.br/).

My collaborators and I were tired of writing variations of the following sentence in the methods section of our papers: _"the reserve where we work has a full complement of regional mastofauna, but low diversity and density of small mammals (unpubl. data)"_. When we discovered CheckList we took our survey data and trapping data,  did some analyses, submitted it, and now have a paper we can cite instead. The reviews were speedy and helpful, including suggestions for alternative analyses and presentations of the data. Submission was a snap and the pdfs of the paper look really sharp - see for yourself.

This journal would be a great outlet for students that generate a species list as part of their work and need practice writing and revising a paper, biological reserves and the researchers who work there, or even for faculty who want to include data collection and the writing of their paper in their ecology field courses.  I also think it could play an important role for researchers in biogeography and macroecology by getting species distribution data peer-reviewed and indexed, rather than relying on unpublished data.
