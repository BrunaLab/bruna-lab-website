Hi all,

We will be having a discussion with Herton Escobar about how he became a science journalist, how he gets ideas for stories, how he approaches writing and reporting, etc. It would be really helpful if everybody could post some questions below in the comments sections: we want to make sure not everybody has the same questions, and also that the questions meet all YOUR needs in terms of what you want to find out.  **Try to make the questions specific and different:** _"How do you get ideas?"_ isn't really good at jump starting conversation, but _"Have you ever had a story idea you thought would flop turn out to be a winner or vice-versa?"_ is.

Thanks, and I'm looking forward to meeting you all.  BTW, you can read a brief bio and find out about his presentation at UF on Wednesday, March 25th: [follow this link](http://www.floridabrazil.org/herton-escobar/).
