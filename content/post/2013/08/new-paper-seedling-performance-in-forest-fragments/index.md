Cris Jurinitz, a recent PhD from the University of SÃ£o Paulo I co-advised with [Alexandre Oliveira](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/labtrop/doku.php?id=labtrop:labtrop), has just published one of her thesis chapters in _Biotropica_. In it, she describes how early-stage survival of two shade-tolerant species is affected by canopy openness, litter depth, ontogenetic stage, and conspecific neighborhood in the understories of secondary forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It's a really nice study, and you can find the final version [here](http://wp.me/a32RIy-ft). Congratulations, Dra. Cris!
