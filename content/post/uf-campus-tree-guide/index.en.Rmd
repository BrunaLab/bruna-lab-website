Students in my graduate course in plant-animal interactions developed a smart phone application designed to teach undergraduate ecology students about plant diversity and plant-animal interactions. It is also a way for the general public to explore the remarkable biodiversity on the UF campus. It maps the locations on the UF campus of over 35 species native to the southeastern US, provides pictures of their fruits, flowers, and other key features, and provides information on the interactions of these trees with different species of animals.
