## Posting on behalf of a new colleague here, Dr. Denis Valle.

##### \-------

##### **Postdoctoral position available on hydroelectric dam impact on human disease in the Brazilian Amazon region, University of Florida**

##### A postdoctoral position is currently available at the University of Florida to study the impact of hydroelectric dams on human disease in the Brazilian Amazon region.

##### The extensive changes in the Brazilian Amazon created by the proposed construction of >30 large hydroelectric dams, as well as other infrastructure development such as roads and intensive agriculture, may cause profound changes in the occurrence and burden of human diseases. There are very few comprehensive studies on the public health impact of deforestation, altered hydrology and changed social patterns caused by dams in this region. The postdoctoral researcher will help to fill this gap by performing an integrated analysis of the public health impact of dams in the Brazilian Amazon region and its socio-environmental drivers. The broad research goal is to quantify the impact of dams on human disease (e.g., malaria) in the Brazilian Amazon with sophisticated Bayesian statistical and simulations methods.

##### The postdoctoral researcher will be part of Dr. Denis Valle lab in the School of Forest Resources and Conservation (University of Florida). One year and two months of funding are currently available but more funding may become available in the future. Details regarding the research of Dr. Denis Valle can be found in the publications listed here: [http://sfrc.ufl.edu/people/faculty/valle/](http://sfrc.ufl.edu/people/faculty/valle/). The postdoctoral researcher is expected to work collaboratively with a highly interdisciplinary team within UF involving experts in Bayesian statistics (Dr. Denis Valle), public health (Dr. Song Liang and Dr. Rick Rheingans), medicine (Dr. Amy Vittor), and remote sensing (Dr. Stephanie Bohlman) to compile secondary data (health, socio-economic, environmental data), develop the models, carry out analyses, and write manuscripts and proposals. The post-doc will also have the opportunity to work with a large interdisciplinary group looking at broader impacts of dam development in the Amazon region.

##### **The required qualifications are:**

- ##### PhD or equivalent in public health, ecology, geography, statistics, or related field by the start date
    
- ##### Strong statistical modeling skills (preferably Bayesian statistics)
    
- ##### Experience programming in R
    
- ##### Interest in the intersection of public policy, public health and large-scale environmental change in the Amazon region
    
- ##### Demonstrated desire to publish in peer-reviewed journals.
    
- ##### Good communication skills including spoken/written English
    

##### **Preferred qualifications:**

- ##### Experience programming with C++
    
- ##### Ability to read in Spanish or Portuguese
    

##### Competitive salary and benefits are available. Application should include: (i) a brief cover letter, (ii) Curriculum Vitae including three professional references, (iii) a brief description of past research accomplishments and future research goals. Applications and additional questions should be sent to Denis Valle at [drvalle@ufl.edu](mailto:drvalle@ufl.edu). Initial review of applications begins 15 May 2014; position open until filled.

##### **Information about Gainesville, Florida:** Situated in the rolling countryside of north central Florida, Gainesville is much more than a stereotypical college town. Home of the University of Florida, seat of Alachua County's government and the region's commercial hub, it is progressive, environmentally conscious and culturally diverse. The presence of many students and faculty from abroad among its 99,000-plus population adds a strong cross-cultural flavor to its historic small-town Southern roots. Its natural environment (e.g., close to several springs and beaches), temperate climate and civic amenities make Gainesville a beautiful, pleasant and interesting place in which to learn and to live. Gainesville has been ranked as one of the best cities to live in the United States.
