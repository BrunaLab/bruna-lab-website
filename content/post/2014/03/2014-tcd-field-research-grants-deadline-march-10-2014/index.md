2014 TCD Field Research Grants \* Deadline March 10, 2014\*

TCD Field Research Grants support field research addressing the issues of

biodiversity conservation, sustainable resource use, and human well-being in

the tropics at Master's and preliminary doctoral levels ((i.e. Doctoral level

funding is intended for initial site visits and preliminary research activities).

Grants will average $2,000 each, but may vary depending on travel costs to

the research site, the availability of funds, and whether the recipient has

received research funding from other sources. The TCD Field Research Grant is

made possible by The Ford Foundation Endowment. TCD funds may be used

for international travel, in-country travel, lodging, meals, and other research-

related expenses.
