Latino Studies:  The Center for Latin American Studies and the College for Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Florida invites applications for a tenure-track assistant or associate professor in the social sciences with a teaching and research focus on Latino/a Studies to begin in August 2015.  Substantive interests may include, but need not be restricted to: immigration; socio-economic issues affecting Latino/a communities; Latino politics; comparative approaches to different Latino groups; the ways that Latinos/as in the US are linked to their countries and communities of origin; and the role of Latino/as in US society. We seek applicants with superior promise who combine rigorous scholarship with excellence in teaching. Candidates should demonstrate an ability to work collaboratively across disciplinary boundaries with faculty and students in various departments and disciplines. The successful candidate will contribute to a broad range of undergraduate and graduate courses and to a new interdisciplinary program initiative in Latino/a Studies.  Candidates should have their Ph.D. in hand or near completion at the time of hiring.

The appointment will be made jointly between the Center for Latin American Studies and the appropriate disciplinary department within the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences. The Center offers a Masters of Arts in Latin American Studies (MALAS), graduate and undergraduate certificates, an undergraduate minor, a joint law degree, and an interdisciplinary specialization in Latino Studies. The Center is linked to departments with strong PhD programs including those where the faculty member for this position will be tenure-track.  More information about the Center can be found at: http://www.latam.ufl.edu/. The College of Liberal Arts & Sciences (CLAS) is UF’s largest college and encompasses the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences, which includes the Departments of Anthropology, Political Science, and Sociology and Criminology & Law (www.clas.ufl.edu). All three of these departments have MA and PhD training programs with faculty who employ diverse theoretical perspectives and methodologies. Social science faculty in CLAS frequently work collaboratively across disciplinary boundaries and are active in research and practice in many countries across Latin America and the Caribbean.

Applications must be submitted on-line http://jobs.ufl.edu/postings/58423. Applications must include the following: (1) a letter of interest (indicating research and teaching interests); (2) current vitae; (3) three current letters of reference.

The University of Florida is an Equal Opportunity Institution dedicated to building a broadly diverse and inclusive faculty and staff.
