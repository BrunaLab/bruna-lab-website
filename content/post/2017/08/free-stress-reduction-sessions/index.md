Grad School is stressful. Being a faculty member is stressful. Being part of the staff that makes it possible for faculty and students to do what they do is stressful. As we start the new semester I wanted to encourage members of the UF community to take advantage of these **100% FREE** [**weekly mindfulness-based stress reduction sessions**](https://psychiatry.ufl.edu/2016/09/09/september-marks-one-year-anniversary-of-mindful-relaxation-minutes/)**.** All you have to do is listen as the instructor guides you through a 30-minute session that will leave you completely rejuvenated (trust me - I have 1st hand experience with the sessions and have known the instructor for years\*). The sessions are at the McKnight Brain Institute but if you can't make in in person **YOU CAN PHONE IN FROM YOUR OFFICE OR THE FIELD!** Really - you can wipe away that frustrating morning of fieldwork with a 30 minute meditation session and then go back out to science some more.  **The sessions are Thursdays at 12:15 - why not try today's?** All the details on how to go or call in are below.

PS: \*Full disclosure: You will notice the instructor and I have the same last name…she’s [my mom](http://www.serenitymindfulnesscenter.com/)! She’s also teaching 2 Mindfulness-Based Meditation classes (Advanced, Beginner) via [Santa Fe College’s Community Education](http://www.sfcollege.edu/cied/communityed/). You can sign up now, [go to this link](http://epublic.sfcollege.edu/ar/AR2901RUICrsListing-en_US.html?termYr=2017&termCD=F&sessionCD=A)) and search for “bruna”. Hurry up, he classes fill quickly.

PPS It has been wonderful to see that [members of our community are talking much more openly about mental health](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/07/13/reflections-on-the-one-year-anniversary-of-my-anxiety-post-including-thoughts-on-how-to-support-students-with-anxiety/). If your institution doesn't have programs like this, why not ask them to set one up? I know an instructor who would love to help out :)
