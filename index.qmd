<!-- **Research in our lab focuses primarily on: (1) the ecology and conservation of tropical biodiversity, (2) plant population dynamics and plant-animal interactions in fragmented tropical landscapes, and (3) the structure of scientific institutions and networks, and how  these structures influence global patterns of scientific productivity.** -->

**We study the ecology and conservation of tropical biodiversity. Most of our research is on (1) how human activities such as habitat fragmentation influence plant demography, plant population dynamics, and plant-animal interactions, and (2) factors influencing the production and spread of knowledge related to tropical ecosystems and how this is shaped by the structure of scientific institutions and networks.**
