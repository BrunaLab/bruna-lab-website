[I started posting data from papers](http://brunalab.org/publications/datasets/) to Dryad and elsewhere a while back, but I finally made a commitment too start posting the code used to manipulate, analyze, and plot the data as well. Since my code generally sucks (meaning it can be is inefficient and ugly), I thought I would post to GitHub instead of as a text file in the paper's online supplement to allow others to improve it if they want to use it.  [My first attempt is here](https://github.com/embruna/Editorial-Board-Gender); this follows an earlier posting of the [java code for a smartphone guide](https://github.com/embruna/UF-tree-guide-for-smartphones) to the trees of the UF campus. Please don't mock the n00b.

I've used some version control platforms before as part of a collaboration with another group, but there is definitely a learning curve. After posting a request on twitter for some suggestions I heard mainly crickets, but here are two places people suggested a newcomer to GitHub could go to learn to use it. \[Edit: also go check out the suggestions in [this post](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/my-first-experience-with-github-for-sharing-data-and-code/) at Dynamic Ecology\]
