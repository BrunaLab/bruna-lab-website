Eric is interested in the mechanisms of plant responses to stress and their consequences for natural and agricultural ecosystems. His current work is on how drought and habitat fragmentation interact to influence *Heliconia acuminata* demography and population dynamics. His [Ph.D. focus](http://teaclimate.org) was on the effects of climate change and insect herbivory on the quality (flavor and health benefits) of tea (*Camellia sinensis*). https://www.ericrscott.com/
