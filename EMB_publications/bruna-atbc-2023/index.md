abstract = "Introduction: The local extinction of species from tropical forest fragments is common; although the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are rarely known, many of them are thought to be driven by reduced rates of individual growth, reproduction, or survivorship. Species in fragmented landscapes must also cope with climate change, whose effects may be particularly acute in tropical ecosystems. While studies assessing the demographic responses of plants to droughts are increasingly common, almost none have been conducted in fragmented landscapes. Those that have typically assess the consequences of only a single drought, so it is unknown if the observed results are typical or an artefact of drought severity. Furthermore, studies of how tropical plants respond to fragmentation or drought typically focus on a limited set of demographic stages (e.g., adults, seedlings). However, without considering multiple life-history stages simultaneously it is challenging to predict how disturbances, either independently or in concert, influence population dynamics and extinction risk. 
Objectives: We used a decade of demographic and climate data from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon to assess the effects of precipitation extremes on the population dynamics of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata (Heliconiaceae).  Methods: We modeled the effect of climate on plant vital rates – including the potential for delayed and non-linear effects – without a priori assumptions about climate windows using distributed lag non-linear models. We then used these results and to parameterize Integral projection models with which we projected 100 years of H. acuminata population dynamics under four IPCC scenarios with different regimes of drought frequency and intensity.Results: We found that delayed detrimental effects of extremes in precipitation on survival were more intense in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. The size transitions of plants in forest fragments were also more influenced by climate compared to continuous forest, with the direction of the effect depending on the lag time and season. Flowering probability was size dependent and much lower in forest fragments due to smaller average plant size. In continuous forest, flowering probability increased during droughts and if there had been a drought two dry seasons prior. 
Implications: Our results suggest that populations in fragments trend towards extinction under all scenarios. In continuous forest the average response was an increase in population size, but the variance was also much greater than in fragments. Consequently, there are many scenarios under which all populations in a landscape will go extinct.
