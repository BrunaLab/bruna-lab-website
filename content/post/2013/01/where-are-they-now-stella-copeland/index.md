Stella Copeland was a Master's student in the lab who I somehow managed to con into going to Brazil and studying Cerrado grasses.  The end result?  [A sweet paper in _Ecosphere_](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/full/10.1890/ES11-00305.1) and a one-way ticket to [Susan Harrison](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Harrison/index.html)'s lab at UC Davis. You can read more about what she is up to these days [here](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Harrison/people/stella/copeland.html).
