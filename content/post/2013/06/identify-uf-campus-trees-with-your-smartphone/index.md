Is that a Slash pine or a Loblolly?  What is the difference between a Water Oak and a Turkey Oak?  If you are interested in learning more about the different trees you see as you wander around the UF campus and own a smartphone with the Android operating system, you can download a field guide to the  trees of the UF campus [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ecology&hl). It was put together by a group of UF graduate students, and includes information on the tree species, the animals that use them, and maps to help you find them (read more about their project in a [paper they wrote](http://brunalab.org/apps/) and this [UF Press Release](http://news.ufl.edu/2011/12/06/tree-app/).
