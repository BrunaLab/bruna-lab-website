We like using Wikipedia in courses so much we [published a paper in _TREE_](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/faculty/brunae/Publications/Callis_etal_2009_TREE.pdf) about the experience; it includes a helpful week-by-week guide to the assignment. Here are a few other resources that may be useful if you are interested in including the editing or writing of Wikipedia entries in your courses.

- Wikipedia maintains a page of useful information, including a link to other courses that have done so [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:School_and_university_projects). Be sure to read the [guide for educators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program/Educators). If your campus has an [Wikipedia Campus Ambassador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CampusVolunteers), take advantage of their help.
- The key for us is to break the assignment into smaller parts - you can see how we did so with [the assignment we gave our students](http://brunalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WikipediaGroupProject-Assignment.pdf).
- [A great discussion over at the Dynamic Ecology blog](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/using-wikipedia-in-the-classroom-a-cautionary-tale/) on a post by Meg Duffy that includes MANY helpful suggestions in the comments. [Read the follow-up post too](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/05/10/follow-up-to-my-cautionary-tale-regarding-using-wikipedia-in-the-classroom/), it has a summary of steps to take if you want to include WP entries as assignments.

Good luck!
