The paper a group of students and I wrote in which we evaluate the gender composition of 10 editorial boards in environmental biology [has just been published in the open access journal _PeerJ_](https://peerj.com/articles/542/). (you can read the backstory on this article [here](http://brunalab.org/blog/2014/04/17/the-backstory-women-are-underrepresented-on-editorial-boards/)). The data [have been archived at the Data Dryad](http://datadryad.org) and will be available soon; the code for the analyses and figures is [posted at GitHub](https://github.com/embruna/Editorial-Board-Gender). Look at us, all Open Science LIKE A BOSS.
