### Update (12/9/14): Wow, I made the "trending" section of [Askmen.com](http://www.askmen.com/) What is that?  Only a website who's mission is "to help guys become Better Men...a movement that has attracted millions upon millions of guys across all ages and backgrounds, and has made \[them\] the world’s No. 1 men’s lifestyle publication."  Whatever. They called this "[the coolest coffee table you've ever seen](http://ca.askmen.com/recess/trending/led-tv-coffee-table.html)".
